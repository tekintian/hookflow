## Devbox

Add hookflow in the devbox environment.
hookflow already exists in the [Nix package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=25.05&show=hookflow&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=hookflow)

```bash
devbox add hookflow@latest
```

**Note**: The devbox plugin for hookflow is maintained by the community. While we appreciate their contribution, the hookflow team cannot provide direct support for devbox-specific installation issues.
